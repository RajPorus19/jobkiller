#+TITLE: Jobscraper

For now this project only scrapes Indeed's job and turns them into a Python object.
In the future there will be more websites that will be scraped.

* How to test it ?

It's recommended that you run it with a virtual environment to prevent conflicts with its
dependencies, for example you can use virtualenv (make sure you have it installed):

** Installation

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/RajPorus19/jobscraper
cd jobscraper
python -m virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install --user
#+end_src

** Running tests

#+begin_src shell
source env/bin/activate
python setup.py test
#+end_src
